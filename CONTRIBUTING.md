feel free to open issues and PRs, but i do reserve the right to accept/reject resources based on arbitrary criteria as this thing is primarily for personal use (tho its clearly grown a bit beyond that). i'm honestly not sure what i want this to ultimately end up being yet, but i hope to have a site up someday showing all these great options.
